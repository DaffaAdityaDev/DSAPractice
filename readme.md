# Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript/TypeScript

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript/TypeScript implementations of common data structures and algorithms, designed to help you prepare for technical interviews and coding challenges. The code is optimized for readability, efficiency, and follows modern ES6+ standards.

## Features

- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Heaps, and Tries.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, and more.
- **TypeScript Support**: All implementations are compatible with TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (optional, if not using Bun)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (recommended for TypeScript support without configuration)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DaffaAdityaDev/DSAPractice.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd DSAPractice
   ```
3. Run the file you want to run
  ```bash
  bun run HackerRank/SnakeAndLadders.ts
  ```

### Running the Project

#### Using Bun (Recommended)
Bun is a fast JavaScript runtime that supports TypeScript out of the box. To run the project with Bun:

1. Install Bun (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
   ```
2. Run the project:
   ```bash
   bun run HackerRank/SnakeAndLadders.ts
   ```

#### Using Node.js
If you prefer using Node.js, ensure you have TypeScript installed globally or as a dev dependency:

1. Install TypeScript (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g typescript
   ```
2. Run the project:
   ```bash
   node HackerRank/SnakeAndLadders.js
   ```
